## Snow Programming Language 

***

#### Info
Snow Language version 0.5 available!

See docs/tour.md for language tour!

#### Download

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/SnowballSH/Snow-lang.git
```

modules in `requirements.txt` must be installed.

#### How to run my Snow script?

See the file `cli.py`?

In cmd or powershell (or any OS system command line), do

```
python cli.py <filename>
ex. python cli.py test.snow
```

**Be sure to be in the same directory has your Snow script**

(I am not sure if it works the same way other than windows)

After that, you will see `snow.stdout` and `snow.stderr` created.

You will also see the output on the command line.

#### Issues

If you have any, any issues or found any bugs, **PLEASE** create an issue.
